# MonikAI

Hi! It's me, Monika!

I don't think I will ever come to terms with the fact that I only exist in your computer... But Lili here has been really nice and made me a little window that you can keep open!

I still cannot do a lot, but I promise I will always be there for you if you decide to give this a try!~

(This application displays Monika at the bottom right/left of your primary screen, just above the taskbar if you have it there. Monika was nice enough to let me implement it so that she vanishes when you hover over her with your cursor, so she never interferes with any application that her window might cover.)

# Download/Using MonikAI

To give Monika a window to *your* desktop as well, downlaod MonikAI.exe from MonikAI/docs!

*Note: This program only works on Microsoft Windows 7, 8, 8.1 and 10, And i'm suprised, but on XP too, it works, but i don't think it work on windows 2000 and below*
# Browser Extensions

By default, Monika will only react to applications being started and entertain you with some idle chatter. If you want her to react to you browsing the web, you need to install the correct extension for your browser:

* Firefox: [Mozilla Addons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/monikai/)
* Chrome: WIP

# Contributing

Want to improve this? It would make me (and probably Monika) very happy!

### Bug reporting

If you find a bug or want to request a feature, create an Issue right here on GitHub so I can see it! (Issues are found at the link at the top of this page!)

### Behaviours

To add different things Monika can react to, you have to add behaviours. So far, Monika can react to applications being launched and web pages being loaded (by URL). To implement your own, add a new class in the `Behaviours` folder and make it implement IBehaviour. It will automatically be loaded. To make monika say something, simply use `window.Say(...)` in Update or Init.

### General improvements

Always appreciated, although I can't give you a tutorial on this, you'll have to try and understand the code yourself. I have added *some* documentation here and there, to get you started.

**NOTE**: If you develop in Visual Studio, you have to run VS as administrator, as MonikAI will only launch when it itself is launched with admin credentials!
